  "summary": "Diff appears to implement the requested ICP static-hosting fixes: Vite `base` is set to `'./'`, TanStack Router is updated toward hash-based routing (imports `createHashHistory`), and a new top-level `AppErrorBoundary` provides a user-visible runtime error fallback with recovery actions. Some additional, non-requested project metadata/docs and build chunk-splitting changes are also present.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added extensive Rollup/Vite `manualChunks` vendor-splitting strategy and increased chunk warning limit (beyond simply setting `base: './'`).",
      "reason": "REQ-2 only requests changing Vite `base` for relative asset paths; chunk splitting is an extra build optimization not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Updated/introduced project tracking and documentation-style summary files (feature request statuses, large component summaries) unrelated to routing/build stability.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals include adding unrelated changes; these files are not part of the requested routing/Vite/error-fallback implementation.",
