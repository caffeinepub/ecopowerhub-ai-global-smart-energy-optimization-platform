  "summary": "Diff updates the marketing header/footer logo <img> to use a /generated/... path and adds a centralized generatedAssetPaths.ts map. However, there is no evidence that the required PNG was added under frontend/public/generated, no evidence of build-time copying to dist, and no evidence of the requested build-time verification step for generated PNG presence/dimensions. Navigation link fixes are only partially evidenced (some footer links changed), while other required link audits are not shown.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the marketing logo PNG exists under frontend/public/generated/ and is copied into frontend/dist/generated/ at build time, and is served from /generated/... reliably in header and footer.",
      "reason": "The header/footer now reference /generated/energyoptim-ai-logo-transparent.dim_200x200.png, but the diff shows no new/added asset file under frontend/public/generated and no build/pipeline changes that ensure copying into frontend/dist/generated at build time.",

      "requirement": "Fix broken internal navigation links in the marketing header/footer so every internal link matches an existing route in frontend/src/App.tsx (e.g., Partner Marketplace and Privacy).",
      "reason": "Only a subset of footer links are visible; the header is truncated and there is no evidence that 'Partner Marketplace' was updated to a valid route, nor that all header/footer internal hrefs were audited against App.tsx routes.",
