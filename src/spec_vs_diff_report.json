  "summary": "REQ-3 (deliver Base64 Slice 1 for the 1024x1024 transparent PNG logo asset) is not implemented in the provided diff. The diff mainly updates/introduces asset inventory/verification/restoration utilities and build verification lists, but does not add the required PNG file under `frontend/public/generated/` nor provide any Base64 slice output. Several unrequested changes add/expand asset verification/restoration infrastructure beyond the single-asset delivery request.",
